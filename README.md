## Overview of the project

## Project : Natural Language Processing
Perform sentiment analysis on text data using NLTK or SpaCy.


### Objective

The main goal is to automatically detect and classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of given text data using Natural Language Processing techniques with NLTK's VADER analyzer.

### Key Activities

✔️ Explored text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization).
✔️ Applied machine learning techniques to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
✔️ Learned how NLP can be applied in real-world scenarios such as customer feedback analysis, product reviews, and social media insights.

### Technologies Used

* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing and sentiment analysis
* VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), included in NLTK, for sentiment scoring
* Python as the programming language
* Optionally, pandas for handling datasets and matplotlib for visualization.

### Key Insights

✔️ VADER is rule-based, fast, and doesn’t require training but may struggle with sarcasm or nuanced context; it provides straightforward sentiment scores from -1 to 1
